### Creational patterns

These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
<br/>
<br/>
#### Singleton

**Singleton** is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

##### How it's Done
<br/>
All implementations of the Singleton have these two steps in common:

* Make the default constructor private, to prevent other objects from using the new operator with the Singleton class.
* Create a static creation method that acts as a constructor. Under the hood, this method calls the private constructor to create an object and saves it in a static field. All following calls to this method return the cached object.
<br/>
If your code has access to the Singleton class, then it’s able to call the Singleton’s static method. So whenever that method is called, the same object is always returned.
<br/>

```java
// Classical Java implementation of singleton 
// design pattern
class Singleton
{
    private static Singleton obj;
 
    // private constructor to force use of
    // getInstance() to create Singleton object
    private Singleton() {}
 
    public static Singleton getInstance()
    {
        if (obj==null)
            obj = new Singleton();
        return obj;
    }
}
```

##### Examples
* Hardware access
* Database connections
* Config files
<br/>

<br/><br/>
#### Factory Method

**Factory Method** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.


##### How it's Done

```python


# Python Code for Object
# Oriented Concepts without
# using Factory method 
 
class FrenchLocalizer:
 
    """ it simply returns the french version """
 
    def __init__(self):
 
        self.translations = {"car": "voiture", "bike": "bicyclette",
                             "cycle":"cyclette"}
 
    def localize(self, msg):
 
        """change the message using translations"""
        return self.translations.get(msg, msg)
 
class SpanishLocalizer:
    """it simply returns the spanish version"""
 
    def __init__(self):
 
        self.translations = {"car": "coche", "bike": "bicicleta",
                             "cycle":"ciclo"}
 
    def localize(self, msg):
 
        """change the message using translations"""
        return self.translations.get(msg, msg)
 
class EnglishLocalizer:
    """Simply return the same message"""
 
    def localize(self, msg):
        return msg
 
if __name__ == "__main__":
 
    # main method to call others
    f = FrenchLocalizer()
    e = EnglishLocalizer()
    s = SpanishLocalizer()
 
    # list of strings
    message = ["car", "bike", "cycle"]
 
    for msg in message:
        print(f.localize(msg))
        print(e.localize(msg))
        print(s.localize(msg))
```

```python
# Python Code for factory method 
# it comes under the creational 
# Design Pattern
 
class FrenchLocalizer:
 
    """ it simply returns the french version """
 
    def __init__(self):
 
        self.translations = {"car": "voiture", "bike": "bicyclette",
                             "cycle":"cyclette"}
 
    def localize(self, msg):
 
        """change the message using translations"""
        return self.translations.get(msg, msg)
 
class SpanishLocalizer:
    """it simply returns the spanish version"""
 
    def __init__(self):
        self.translations = {"car": "coche", "bike": "bicicleta",
                             "cycle":"ciclo"}
 
    def localize(self, msg):
 
        """change the message using translations"""
        return self.translations.get(msg, msg)
 
class EnglishLocalizer:
    """Simply return the same message"""
 
    def localize(self, msg):
        return msg
 
def Factory(language ="English"):
 
    """Factory Method"""
    localizers = {
        "French": FrenchLocalizer,
        "English": EnglishLocalizer,
        "Spanish": SpanishLocalizer,
    }
 
    return localizers[language]()
 
if __name__ == "__main__":
 
    f = Factory("French")
    e = Factory("English")
    s = Factory("Spanish")
 
    message = ["car", "bike", "cycle"]
 
    for msg in message:
        print(f.localize(msg))
        print(e.localize(msg))
        print(s.localize(msg))
```

##### Advantages of using Factory method: 
1. We can easily add new types of products without disturbing the existing client code.
2. Generally, tight coupling is being avoided between the products and the creator classes and objects.

##### Examples
* Notification System (Email, MSG, Call, Etc.)
* Language Translation App
* Ridesharing App

<br/><br/>
#### Builder Method
**Builder** is a creational design pattern, which allows constructing complex objects step by step.  
- It’s especially useful when you need to create an object with lots of possible configuration options.  
- Builder methods often support chaining (for example, someBuilder.setValueA(1).setValueB(2).create()).  

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Any


class Builder(ABC):
    """
    The Builder interface specifies methods for creating the different parts of
    the Product objects.
    """

    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def product(self) -> None:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def produce_part_a(self) -> None:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def produce_part_b(self) -> None:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def produce_part_c(self) -> None:
        pass


class ConcreteBuilder1(Builder):
    """
    The Concrete Builder classes follow the Builder interface and provide
    specific implementations of the building steps. Your program may have
    several variations of Builders, implemented differently.
    """

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        """
        A fresh builder instance should contain a blank product object, which is
        used in further assembly.
        """
        self.reset()

    def reset(self) -> None:
        self._product = Product1()

    @property
    def product(self) -> Product1:
        """
        Concrete Builders are supposed to provide their own methods for
        retrieving results. That's because various types of builders may create
        entirely different products that don't follow the same interface.
        Therefore, such methods cannot be declared in the base Builder interface
        (at least in a statically typed programming language).

        Usually, after returning the end result to the client, a builder
        instance is expected to be ready to start producing another product.
        That's why it's a usual practice to call the reset method at the end of
        the `getProduct` method body. However, this behavior is not mandatory,
        and you can make your builders wait for an explicit reset call from the
        client code before disposing of the previous result.

        self.reset()
        return product

class Product1():
    """
    It makes sense to use the Builder pattern only when your products are quite
    complex and require extensive configuration.

    Unlike in other creational patterns, different concrete builders can produce
    unrelated products. In other words, results of various builders may not
    always follow the same interface.

class Director:
    """
    The Director is only responsible for executing the building steps in a
    particular sequence. It is helpful when producing products according to a
    specific order or configuration. Strictly speaking, the Director class is
    optional, since the client can control builders directly.

    """

    initiates the construction process. The end result is retrieved from the
    builder object.

### Structural patterns

These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
<br/>
<br/>

#### Adapter Method

**Adapter** is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
- often used in systems based on some legacy code. In such cases, Adapters make legacy code work with modern classes.
- Converting one type of data to another that can be used in the next function call.

```python
class Target:
    """
    The Target defines the domain-specific interface used by the client code.
    """

    def request(self) -> str:
        return "Target: The default target's behavior."


class Adaptee:
    """
    The Adaptee contains some useful behavior, but its interface is incompatible
    with the existing client code. The Adaptee needs some adaptation before the
    client code can use it.
    """

    def specific_request(self) -> str:
        return ".eetpadA eht fo roivaheb laicepS"


class Adapter(Target, Adaptee):
    """
    The Adapter makes the Adaptee's interface compatible with the Target's
    interface via multiple inheritance.
    """

    def request(self) -> str:
        return f"Adapter: (TRANSLATED) {self.specific_request()[::-1]}"


def client_code(target: "Target") -> None:
    """
    The client code supports all classes that follow the Target interface.
    """

    print(target.request(), end="")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Client: I can work just fine with the Target objects:")
    target = Target()
    client_code(target)
    print("\n")

    adaptee = Adaptee()
    print("Client: The Adaptee class has a weird interface. "
          "See, I don't understand it:")
    print(f"Adaptee: {adaptee.specific_request()}", end="\n\n")

    print("Client: But I can work with it via the Adapter:")
    adapter = Adapter()
    client_code(adapter)
```

<br/><br/>

### Behavioral patterns

These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
